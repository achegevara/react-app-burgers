This is my first React project, which was developed while studying React.
It's a simple burger-order app, which consists of the following components:
- menu
- order
- admin panel,

and allows to manage menu(add/remove burgers, make them available/unavailable, change their properties like name, price, description etc.) 
and add menu items to the order. <br />
App data is stored in the Google Firebase and is updated in a real-time mode. <br />

The app covers only the frontend part of the process and does not make orders for real ;)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory(in a terminal):

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
